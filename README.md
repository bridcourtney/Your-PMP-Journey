<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

Sligo PMI Training is an approved provider of project management training by the Project Management Institute (PMI). As a PMI Authorized Training Partner (ATP), our training courses have been reviewed against PMI's Quality Assurance guidelines.

For Sligo PMI Training to gain accreditation for its educational programmes, accreditation bodies carefully evaluate and verify that Sligo PMI Training meets and exceeds their rigorous quality criteria for course content, qualified instructors, instructional design, verified learning outcomes and maintenance of the highest standards of professional and ethical business practices.

PMP certification can be extremely valuable if you plan to advance in the current company you are working at. It puts you way ahead of your colleagues in terms of moving up the career ladder. Also, a certified manager can do much better in a gruelling project management interview than a non-certified one.

The fail rate for the PMP exam is quite high at an estimated 40-50% for first-time test-takers. There is no specific number of questions that must be answered correctly in order to pass the PMP exam.  This is high and can be a costly journey.  

Anyone who aspires to attain PMP certification should be prepared for the exam. Consequently, first-time test takers should also be advised that the PMP certification exam is extremely difficult. The exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions in a period of only four hours.

  -   ## Design Choices
  
   -   ### Colour Scheme
        - The orange NavBar is eye catching and and the orange text in the footer pulls the two elements together.  
        - There is alot of whitespace in the Product and Course, Basket and Checkout Pages.  The whitespace draws attention and attracts the user to the eyecatching buttons             and good quality images
    
   -   ### Imagery 
       I selected images that are relevant to the content of the application.  
      
      
   -   ### Font & Icons 
       - I selected Josefin Sans for consistent font throughout the Site 
       - The icons in the navbar are a good fit for the theme of the application
       - Icons break up the information visually, creating space for the user and not overwhelming them with too much info at once.     

-   ## Wireframes
    
    Wireframes were built in the early stages of development to get a rough outline of the structure needed for the planned features of the site. The wireframes were created     using Balsamiq. These can be viewed below:

## Features Left to Implement

I would like to allow User to Edit / Delete their Reviews and Testimonial.  At the moment this is only possible from the Django Admin Area.  I would also like to render the Users testimonial & Reviews to their User Profile page

 
# 3. Information Architecture
## Database choice

During the development phase I worked with sqlite3 database which is installed with Django.  For deployment(production), a PostgreSQL database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

## Data Modelling
The User model is provided by Django as a part of defaults django.contrib.auth.models.

The following apps were created for this website -  About, Bag, Checkout, Contact, Home, Products, Profiles & Testimonials.

- The Products App contains the following Models - Product, Category, ProductReview & DatesAvailable.
- The Checkout App contains the following Models - Order & OrderLineItem

The following is the websites ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) -

# 5. Testing

The application was tested to ensure it successfully met the expectations of each User Story without error.  Please view the Executed Test Protocol in link below - 

 -   Executed Test Protocol - [View](data/Test_Protocol/test_Protocol.pdf)

## 404 & 500 Error Handling

The pages are created, and django handles all 404 requests & 500 and redirects to the relevant template. All attempts to access invalid URLS returns the 404 page.  Also if a Visitor trys to access pages only for registered User access, a 404 will be returned.

    
## Validators

All the HTML files were tested through W3C Markup Validation Service.

### CSS

CSS files were tested through W3C CSS Validation Service.

### JavaScript

Script files were tested through W3C CSS Validation Service. 


### Python

All python files were tested through PEP8 Online validator. 


### Compatibility and Responsiveness

 I used the Google Chrome's developer tools to see how it looks across all the different device screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
 I also used Am I Responsive online tool for checking responsiveness on different devices.

### Known Bugs

Courses are in the Product Model, what differentiates Course from Products is the is_a_service boolean flag in the Product Model.
Courses therefore can be added / edited & deleted by SuperUsers in Product Mangement Section.  When a SuperUser performs any of the CRUD Actions on a Course, they are redircted to the Product Details page. 
I know how to fix the issue, but did not have time to complete

## Deployment to Heroku
The following steps are required to deploy this site to Heroku:

1. Create a new app in Heroku with a unique name, chose your region
2. Go to Resources, within Add-ons searched Heroku Postgres, choose Hobby Dev - Free version, then click Provision button.
3. In Settings click on Reveal Config Vars button, and copy the value of DATABASE_URL
4. Return to terminal window and run sudo pip3 install dj_database_url
5. Run sudo pip3 install psycopg2. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
6. Go to settings.py and add import dj_database_url and updated DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))} also update env.py with os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://postgres key - copied earlier from Heroku")
7. Run python3 manage.py makemigrations, then python3 manage.py migrate to migrate all existing migrations to postgres database.
8. Create a superuser: python3 manage.py createsuperuser
9. Log into Amazon AWS, Go to S3 and create a new S3 bucket.
10. Return to terminal window and run sudo pip3 install django-storages and sudo pip3 install boto3.
11. In settings.py add storages to INSTALLED_APPS.

    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

13. Update env.py with AWS keys (these keys are from S3).
14. Create custom_storages.py at the top level:
15. From django.conf import settings
16. From storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

17. Go to settings.py and add:
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'

MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'

18. Return to terminal window and run python3 manage.py collectstatic

22. Create a Procfile using the following command: echo web: gunicorn ms4.wsgi:application
22. Run git add ., git commit -m "my commit message" and git push commands to push all changes to GitHub repository.
23. Return to Heroku and hit Deploy Branch
24. Once the build is complete, click on Open app
25. Go to settings.py and add pmp-journey.herokuapp.com to ALLOWED_HOSTS
26. Run git add ., git commit -m "my commit message" and git push commands to push all changes to GitHub repository.

### Hosting media files with AWS

The static files and media files (that will be uploaded by superuser - product images) are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with public access.

### Sending email via Gmail

To send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your Gmail account, setting up your email address in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your app password generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.

### Google Maps API key set up
1. In the Google Cloud Platform Console create a new project.
2. Click Continue to enable the API and any related services.
3. Get an API key and set the API key restrictions on the Credentials page. 
4. Add your Google Maps key into the environment variable locally in the env.py file:
5. os.environ["GOOGLE_MAP_KEY"] = "<Your Google Map key>" and in production in the Heroku Config Vars as GOOGLE_MAP_KEY.

# 7. Code & Credits
 - The idea of Google Map API in Contact Form was inspired from https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea
 - The idea to flag course by Boolean is_a_service in the Product Model was inspired from https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea
 - The project's code was developed by following the Code Institute lessons for the Boutique Ado Django Mini-Project, and customised to meet the requirements of my project
